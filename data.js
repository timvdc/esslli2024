    "group": "Evening",
    "description": "Currently, the most successful approach to natural language processing is based on large pretrained language models using the transformer architecture of neural networks. These are typically pretrained on huge text corpora on the tasks of predicting next tokens or masked tokens. While most existing models are predominantly monolingual, multilingual variants also exist and can help in cross-lingual transfer of knowledge and models. We will present a few types of large language models, focusing on cross-lingual transfer. We will show their strengths and weaknesses in text classification, summarization, and question answering.",

Still, plenty of research in Natural Language Processing does not explicitly account for such interplay. This evening lecture will zoom in on precisely this aspect. “Precisely” is an ambitious term, since the very definition of the relationship between language technology and society is subject to multiple interpretations, both in the context of scientific research as well as in connection with the general public, who currently is very much exposed to, interested in, and involved with language-based artificial intelligence tools. Through recent work I’ve carried out with my group, and through personal reflections, I will unpack this exciting relationship from different angles.",

In particular, it shall overview how understanding the role of sharing in the evaluation process is crucial for both time and space, but for opposite reasons.\nThe second part of the talk shall show that extending the lambda calculus with first-class sharing is not a minor extension, as crucial semantic properties and results break, and new tools and richer theories need to be developed.",

We discuss: - What are knowledge representations? This is about Ontologies, Knowledge Graphs, and semantic web approaches to handle for example Description Logic representations and reasoning. - What are Large Language Models and, ultimately, Large Models? This is mainly addressing so-called Generative AI, approaches to building and training models, and their application and limits, when the input is unstructured text or visual information only. - How can LMs and computational semantics approaches be combined? This addresses general problems of LMs (e.g., hallucinations), and we discuss how symbolic (and also probabilistic) knowledge representations can be linked to LMs generating more reliable responses, summaries, even pragmatic aspects like implicatures and presuppositions. We also discuss how LMs can be trained on knowledge and semantic representations to improve their reasoning capabilities. This course can be accompanied by extensive material, code, and instructions shared with students and the community, including hands-on access to the respective technologies. Depending on the audience, interest, and goals, we can adjust the level and content and design the course to include a discussion of state-of-the-art approaches to the generation of Ontologies, taxonomies, and Knowledge Graph representations. This course might sound technologically challenging, but we can assure you that it is actually within the scope of advanced undergraduate students, certainly appropriate for interested graduate students coming with basic computation experience, knowledge of statistics, and interest in logic, semantics, and knowledge representations.",

This introductory course will explore recent work on the Curry-Howard correspondence between substructural logics and concurrent processes, dubbed as \“Propositions as Sessions\”. Following a gradual approach, participants will learn how Girard’s linear logic and its extensions serve as a basis for structuring message-passing concurrent programs through the discipline of session types. No specific prerequisites are assumed for this course, except for familiarity with formal logic; participants will get familiar with the selected topics in Substructural Logics, Concurrency Theory, and Programming Languages.

They nowadays play a fundamental role not only in mathematical and philosophical logic, but also in applied areas ranging from automated deduction to program verification, databases and knowledge representation. They are used, for instance, as explainers of why sets of program states are disjoint and as synthesisers of concepts, programs and queries. The purpose of this course is to introduce the logical foundations and applications of Craig interpolation. We cover formalisms ranging from propositional and first-order logic to description and temporal logic. We illustrate modern applications, focusing on databases and knowledge representation. Finally, we also discuss recent research on what to do if a logic does not enjoy the Craig interpolation property, i.e., when there are entailments without Craig interpolants. We give an an introduction to Craig Interpolation and its modern applications in computer science, including databases, knowledge representation, complexity theory, and program verification.",

The consistency of the probability assessments is guaranteed by a coherence principle. All basic probabilistic properties follow from coherence. A large number of philosophers and psychologists assume valid that the probability of a natural language conditional, P(if H then A), coincides with the conditional subjective probability P(A|H) of the conditional event A|H. Usually, a conditional event is looked at as a three-valued object and compound conditionals have been defined in trivalent logics. We verify that none of these logics satisfies all the basic probabilistic properties valid for unconditional events. Then, we consider an approach to compound conditionals in the setting of conditional random quantities. We verify that all the basic logical and probabilistic properties are preserved and  we illustrate applications to the psychology of uncertain reasoning, to connexive logic and to non-monotonic reasoning.",

          "description": "The creation of resources for Natural Language Processing (NLP) typically involves human participants. Presented with some verbal material, independent annotators express their personal understanding of a given linguistic phenomenon. The judgments they provide often have tremendous internal variability: language is ambiguous, and its comprehension subjective, in such a way that multiple interpretations can hold for the same piece of data. In this light, putting into sharp focus how to deal with annotation disagreements is of paramount importance for any data collection activity, to clarify when humans' divergent views affect the quality of the final resource or rather represent different (yet all legitimate) text understanding perspectives.\nThis course will introduce students to the \"perspectivist\" approach to data collection, i.e., one that embraces the diversity of human annotations. It will cover potential sources of disagreement to consider when designing annotation schemes, strategies to evaluate the quality of data in a perspectivist framework, as well as methods to make use of disagreements for learning automatic models.",

Conceptual explanations do not derive their explanatory power from a network of causal relations, but rather from a network of conceptual relations. Thus, conceptual explanations are prime facie a natural object for logical analysis. A rising amount of work has been dedicated to the application of proof-theoretical methods to formalise the notion of conceptual explanation: this work not only combines well-known proof-theoretic techniques, such as cut-elimination or normalization, with a deep philosophical analysis, but also it has introduced in logic the notion of explanation, a notion which has been so far largely neglected. The goal of this course is to make the student acquainted with the notion of conceptual explanation together with the proof-theoretic method used for its formalization.",

The foundations of arithmetic theories lie at the interface of logic, geometry and automata theory.\nThis course is an introduction to linear arithmetic theories, with an emphasis on Pres- burger arithmetic, the first-order theory of the integers with addition and order. We start by exploring the subject bottom up, introducing linear arithmetic theories with problems coming from optimisation and AI. Subsequently, we cover classic algorithms for linear and integer programming. The last three lectures focus on three algorithmic paradigms to decide Presburger arithmetic based on quantifier elimination, finite-state automata, and geometric decision procedures. We emphasise differences between these techniques by studying exten- sions of Presburger arithmetic that can be tackled in a natural way only within one of the three. We also demonstrate software offering support for these paradigms: RedLog (quan- tifier elimination), Walnut (finite-state automata), and SageMath (geometric procedures",

This course will take students into the very active and growing area of research today concerned with providing a good semantics of fiction. This field contains many open problems. It is essentially interdisciplinary (at the intersection of philosophy of language, formal linguistics, logic and literary studies) and it questions the foundations of our best semantic theories.",

With this, we can state that everything the agent believes is the case, that the agent believes that they believe something false, or that everything believed by one agent is believed by a second agent.\nStandard possible world models for modal logics can be extended straightforwardly to propositional quantifiers, by letting these quantifiers range over arbitrary sets of worlds. However, in many cases, this straightforward model theory leads to logics which are not recursively axiomatizable. In addition to these simple models, we will therefore consider a range of alternative models, including models based on complete Boolean algebras, and possible worlds models in which propositional quantifiers range over a restricted domain of sets of worlds.\nThe aim of the course is to show the usefulness of propositional quantifiers in modal logics using examples, to provide a systematic overview of the work that has been done in this field, and to highlight some of the many interesting questions which remain open.\nThe course level will be Introductory.",

After a short introduction to the formal semantics of plurals, the first part of the course will analyze meanings of reciprocal quantifiers (‘each other’). We will address their cross-linguistic relations with distributivity and collectivity, anaphora and reflexivity, and analyze pragmatic and lexical effects on their selection. The second part of the course will discuss reciprocal predicates (‘meet’, ‘hug’, ‘friend’), their logical effects on symmetry of n-ary relational meanings, and conceptual interactions with events and thematic roles. Overall, the proposed course will serve as an up-to-date example of the heterogeneity of formal semantics, illustrating its development from a subfield of philosophical logic to an interdisciplinary domain in linguistics that also engages with syntactic theory, lexical and typological analysis, and psycholinguistics.",

On the one hand, computational (e.g., Bayesian or information theoretic) models rationalize speaker behavior and explain how the listener can use the given information efficiently to infer the intended meaning from an utterance. However, these models often leave the stepwise processing of linguistic information unspecified. On the other hand, procedural procedural (e.g., automata or ACT-R) models explain step-by-step cognitive processes behind meaning-related computations e.g., the process of building sentence representations. However, they often lack the means to combine different information types in an interactive fashion.

But for all its importance, there has been relatively little discussion of foundational issues. Stalnaker (2002, 2014) is a notable exception, but he only discusses his own view. There are radically different views on the nature of common ground, i.e. what common ground IS, and there have been no attempts to compare and contrast these views at any length, and consider their implications for the analysis of speech acts and fiction, for example.

We will prove multiple theoretical properties of RNNs, including the fact that simple RNNs with infinite precision arithmetic and unbounded computation time can emulate a Turing machine and show how RNNs can optimally represent finite-state automata.

Some of the notable examples of DELs include public announcement logic, arrow update logic, and action model logic. Adding quantification over epistemic events in those DELs shifts the perspective from the effects of a particular event to the question of (non-)existence of an event leading to some epistemic outcome. For example, we may want to verify that there is a communication between Alice and Bob such that they both learn some secret, while eavesdropper Eve remains unaware of the secret. In the course, we will present some of the more well-known DELs with quantification and provide highlights of the proofs behind significant technical results.

We introduce the concepts of formal language, formal grammar and automaton, and the notion of complexity reflected by the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy. We present how natural language and popular syntactic formalisms fit into this picture. We review at length the evolution of parsing algorithms for natural language, from the classic chart-based paradigm to contemporary shift-reduce parsers, graph-based algorithms, and CCG parsing. We discuss the impact on the field of the advances in machine-learning and introduce some of the key aspects of neural-based parsers and in particular the use of the vector representations of linguistic units produced by language models.",

          "title": "A Uniform Meaning Representation for NLP Systems",
          "group": "Advanced",
          "description": "Impressive progress has been made in many aspects of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. Most notably, the achievements of transformer-based large language models such as ChatGPT would seem to obviate the need for any type of semantic representation beyond what can be encoded as contextualized word embeddings of surface text. Advances have been particularly notable in areas where large training data sets exist and it is advantageous to build an end-to-end training architecture without resorting to intermediate representations. For any truly interactive NLP applications, however, a more complete understanding of the information conveyed by each sentence is needed to advance the state of the art. Here \"understanding'' entails the use of some form of meaning representation. NLP techniques that can accurately capture the required elements of the meaning of each utterance in a formal representation are critical to making progress in these areas and have long been a central goal of the field.\nAs with end-to-end NLP applications, the dominant approach for deriving meaning representations from raw textual data is through the use of machine learning and appropriate training data. This allows the development of systems that can assign appropriate meaning representations to previously unseen sentences. Generating training data that represents meaning, however, is a very different undertaking from collecting human translated text or transcribed speech as it is not ``naturally occurring.'' It requires the development of a consensus on formal meaning representations that can be used by humans to annotate significant amounts of data for the sole purpose of training the machine learning algorithms.  This has been an elusive target because it is a delicate balancing act between a number of factors. It must provide fair and equal treatment for multiple languages, be intuitive enough to enable fast, consistent human annotation, and support the training of accurate, useful automatic modules that work well in downstream applications.  A meaning representation that strikes the right balance would solve one of the long-standing intellectual problems in the field and  have a transformative effect on NLP specifically, and on Artificial Intelligence in general.\nIn this course, we describe the framework of Uniform Meaning Representations (UMRs), a recent cross-lingual, multi-sentence incarnation of Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), that addresses these issues and comprises such a transformative representation. Incorporating Named Entity tagging, discourse relations, intra-sentential coreference, a partial treatment of negation and modality, and the popular PropBank-style predicate argument structures with semantic role labels, into a single directed acyclic graph structure,  UMR builds on AMR and keeps the essential characteristics of AMR while making it cross-lingual and extending it to a document-level representation.\nWe introduce the basic structural representation of UMR and describe its application to multiple languages. We present a formal semantic interpretation of UMR incorporating a continuation-based semantics for scope phenomena involving modality, negation, and quantification. We describe how UMR encodes TAM (Tense Aspect Modality) information in multiple languages. We describe parsing algorithms that generate AMR and UMR representations over multiple languages. Finally, we introduce an extension to UMR for encoding gesture in multimodal dialogue, Gesture AMR (GAMR), which aligns with speech-based UMR to account for situated grounding in dialogue.",

          "group": "Introductory",
          "description": "The (pure, untyped) lambda-calculus is a Turing-complete model of computation, simply based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. Thanks to thesimplicity of the formal system, it is well suited for theoretical investigations in mathematical logic, categorical theory, computability and even complexity. On the other hand, the lambda-calculus is at the core of many functional programming languages (such as LISP, Haskell, OCaml) and proof-assistants (such as Coq and Agda).\nThere are many variants of the lambda-calculus where functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given input's \"type\" of data. Typed lambda-calculi are weaker than the untyped lambda calculus, in the sense that the former can express less than the latter can, but on the other hand typed lambda-calculi can only represent \"well-behaved\" programs, in that \"well-typed programs cannot go wrong\" (R. Milner).\nIn this course we investigate two typed versions of the lambda-calculus. The first one is the simply typed lambda-calculus, which is the computational counterpart--via Curry-Howard correspondence--of natural deduction for intuitionistic propositional logic. We will show that there every evaluation strategy terminates (strong normalization) for every simply typed lambda-term, but the type system is too restrictive because there are \"well-behaved\" programs that cannot be represented there.\nThe second typed variant of the lambda-calculus we will study is the one endowed with a non-idempotent intersection type system. Such a type system increase the typability power of simple types by introducing a new intersection type constructor ∧, which commutative, associative and non-idempotent (A ∧ A is not equivalent to A). The intuition is that term of type A ∧ A ∧ B can be seen as a resource that, during execution, can be used once as a data of type B and twice as a data of type A. Non-idempotent intersection types constitute a powerful tool to reason about qualitative semantic properties of programs: we will show that they characterize different notions of termination in the lambda-calculus, for different notions of evaluation. In this respect, non-idempotent intersection types are able to capture all and only the \"well-behaved\" programs, if we assume that a \"good behavior\" is the fact that evaluation terminates. Moreover, they not only provide qualitative characterization of operational properties, but also quantitative ones, in the sense that any type derivation of a term gives a bound to the execution time for that term (the number of steps to reach a normal form).",

The course will conclude by surveying other consistency proofs and classifications of PA's provably total recursive functions, namely via Goedel's T, a higher-typed of primitive recursion, as well as the adaptation of these results to important fragments and extensions of PA.",

          "description": "Formal semantics based on modern type theories (MTT-semantics) provides us with not only a viable alternative to Montague’s semantics, but potentially an attractive full-blown semantic tool with advantages in many respects. However, the salient features of MTT-semantics may only be discussed properly when more advanced semantic topics are considered. For example, people may ask: how does it fare with semantic issues such as events and anaphoric reference, and could it offer a good treatment of intriguing linguistic features such as copredication? In the past, some of these advanced issues have only been dealt with briefly [1], but more recently they have been studied more in depth in the proposer’s monograph [2]. In this course, after an overview introduction, I shall consider the following topics in MTT-semantics: event semantics, anaphoric references, copredication and dependent categorial grammars. I’ll also compare the treatments with those studied in the Montagovian approach and discuss their respective merits.\n[1] S. Chatzikyriakidis and Z. Luo. Formal Semantics in Modern Type Theories.

          "description": "Classical dynamic accounts of anaphora rely on logical operators arbitrarily manipulating anaphoric information. Alongside conceptual concerns of explanatory (in)adequacy, classical accounts are known to make poor empirical predictions for non-veridical environments (see, e.g., Roberts 1987, Krahmer and Muskens 1995). In this course, we motivate an alternative approach, which treats logical operators as fundamentally truth-functional. In the first half of the course, we explore an approach to anaphora based on the Strong Kleene account of presupposition projection. The initial goal will be to derive and improve upon Groenendijk & Stokhof's (1991) accessibility generalizations, with a particular focus on negation and disjunction. The latter half of the course zooms in on counterfactual content: The initial Strong Kleene account fails to capture key constraints on the (anti)veridicality of anaphorically active content. We revise the account by intensionalizing discourse referents, which are in turn interpreted relative to both a local and a global intensional context.",

This course focuses on a promising framework to model these human cognitive skills: the probabilistic Language of Thought (LoT). We will start with the philosophical underpinnings of the program in the work of Jerry Fodor. Then, we will discuss recent developments, combining the LoT with probabilistic approaches to learning to develop models of category acquisition across a variety of conceptual domains. This will require a discussion of several technical tools (formal grammars, compositional semantics, Bayesian inference).

These are versatile models, consisting of a set of alternatives and a relation, denoted <, between them that indicates \"betterness\" or \"preference\" of some kind. The versatility comes from the fact that preferences, and the alternatives that they rank, can mean many things in different contexts.\nThe most straightforward meaning is if < represents a utility comparison of an agent, e.g., \"coffee < tea\". But < could also represent a plausibility ordering (more plausible is \"better\"), a defeat relation among strategies (\"scissors < rock\"), et cetera. By studying preference structure we can improve our understanding of all these different interpretations of <.\nWe will study these structures through the vehicle of conditional logics. These logics have an operator B(p|q), with the meaning that \"if q holds, then p is the best choice\". In particular, we will investigate how B(p|q) depends on assumptions about <.",

A team can be naturally viewed as a database, a dataset, an information state, etc. Thanks to the simple structure of teams and the abundance of their interpretations in various fields of science, DIL have found a number of applications in addressing issues in database theory, social choice, quantum theory, formal linguistics, and so on.
