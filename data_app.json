The coverage will be limited to classical first order logic (FOL). This is far from the only logic used in linguistics, but it is presupposed by most advanced work. FOL is presented in a way which highlights the assumptions and choices made and the plurality of logics (as promised by the title), providing pointers to further directions of study.",

Stalnaker (1971) and many following have argued that there is a close connection between conditionals and rational decision: at a first pass, you should do the act that, in expectation, WOULD bring about the best consequences IF you were to do it. This intuitive picture both constrains, and is constrained by, the theory of the conditional (in particular, its logic and semantics, and corresponding probabilities). The course will explore the interacting perspectives of decision theory (Fusco\u2019s specialty) and conditional semantics (Mandelkern\u2019s specialty).",

We address the following questions:\n\n- What are knowledge representations? This is about ontologies, Knowledge Graphs, and semantic web approaches to handle, for example, Description, Logic representations, and reasoning.\n - What are Large Language Models and, ultimately, Large Models? This mainly addresses so-called Generative AI, approaches to building and training models, and their application and limits when the input is unstructured text or visual information only.\n\nHow can LMs and computational semantics approaches be combined? This addresses general problems of LMs (e.g., hallucinations), and we discuss how symbolic (and also probabilistic) knowledge representations can be linked to LMs generating more reliable responses, summaries, and even pragmatic aspects like implicatures and presuppositions. We also discuss how LMs can be trained on knowledge and semantic representations to improve their reasoning capabilities.\nThis course is accompanied by extensive material, code, and instructions shared with students and the community, including hands-on access to the respective technologies. Depending on the audience, interest, and goals, we can adjust the level and content and design the course to include a discussion of state-of-the-art approaches to the generation of ontologies, taxonomies, and Knowledge Graph representations. This course might sound technologically challenging, but we can assure you that it is actually within the scope of undergraduate students and is certainly appropriate for interested graduate students coming with basic computation experience, knowledge of statistics, and interest in logic, semantics, and knowledge representations.",

The correspondence can be seen as a fruitful principle for logically-informed foundations of programming languages. This introductory course will explore recent work on the Curry-Howard correspondence between substructural logics and concurrent processes, dubbed as \u201cPropositions as Sessions\u201d. Following a gradual approach, participants will learn how Girard\u2019s linear logic and its extensions serve as a basis for structuring message-passing concurrent programs through the discipline of session types. No specific prerequisites are assumed for this course, except for familiarity with formal logic; participants will get familiar with the selected topics in Substructural Logics, Concurrency Theory, and Programming Languages.

They nowadays play a fundamental role not only in mathematical and philosophical logic, but also in applied areas ranging from automated deduction to program verification, databases and knowledge representation. They are used, for instance, as explainers of why sets of program states are disjoint and as synthesisers of concepts, programs and queries. The purpose of this course is to introduce the logical foundations and applications of Craig interpolation. We cover formalisms ranging from propositional and first-order logic to description and temporal logic. We illustrate modern applications, focusing on databases and knowledge representation. Finally, we also discuss recent research on what to do if a logic does not enjoy the Craig interpolation property, i.e., when there are entailments without Craig interpolants. We give an an introduction to Craig Interpolation and its modern applications in computer science, including databases, knowledge representation, complexity theory, and program verification.",

Acquaintance with such facts is of general interest, presenting an exciting opportunity to raise architectural questions about natural language and to expose course participants to a diverse set of formal methods (e.g., constraint-based grammars, model theoretic semantics). We begin the course with elements of intonational phonology: The realization of suprasegmental features\u2014i.e., pitch, loudness and duration\u2014is structured and governed by abstract mental categories. We then turn to modeling how these prosodic structures interface with syntactic structure, as well as semantic and pragmatic interpretation. The empirical basis for these models involve both classical observations on the role of intonation in regulating discourse coherence, and ongoing debates on the effect of intonation on presupposition triggering and projection.",

For millennia, philosophers, logicians, and linguists investigated negation. More recently, the processing of negation became a cornerstone of psycholinguistics and cognitive science. Experiments firmly established that negative sentences are more difficult to process than affirmative ones. However, the source of this difficulty is still debated. Since the 1970s, competing explanations have been proposed and coined into processing models of negation. During this course, we will dissect and compare prominent processing models of negation that explain processing difficulties by implementing answers to fundamental questions about pragmatic language use, amodal representations, cognitive biases, conflict between cognitive representations, as well as the nature of verification and comprehension processes. Example questions we will address include: (1)Are there circumstances that completely alleviate the processing difficulty of negation? (2)Is this processing difficulty language-specific or due to domain-general mechanisms of conflict resolution?",

However, methodological principles and experimental design are often neglected, leading to shaky conclusions, stressful paper writing, and unfavourable reviews.

As methodology is often considered boring or unimportant, we start from examples, and realistic situations before introducing abstract notions. Practical exercises allow making the subject more fun, grounding abstract notions on concrete examples, and training skills such as structuring research questions, designing experiences, analysing and presenting results. We collaboratively build an ideal of scientific methodology and compare it with current practice, trying to avoid simplistic good/bad judgments. Skills developed should help move our habits towards this ideal. We see this as a privileged moment to study notions frequently used without full understanding, but greatly influencing our research's quality.",

These new logics have several applications in many different areas of research such as database theory, linguistics, and philosophy. The main goal of this course is to introduce propositional variants of dependence and inclusion logic and to investigate their expressivity and computational complexity of satisfiability, validity, and model checking.

Instead of emphasizing truth values, as in classical logic, or proofs, as in intuitionistic logic, linear logic emphasizes the role of formulas as resources. In this course, our aim is to introduce fundamental concepts and techniques of linear logic through a proof-theoretic approach. We will first present the sequent calculus formalism of linear logic, and present the graph theoretical syntax of linear logic, proof nets. Then, we will delve into its denotational semantics, the semantics of proofs, in terms of coherence spaces.

While using such words has sometimes no significant effects, in many cases their use can produce real harm, by denigrating, silencing, and marginalizing the people they target. Slurs are one such type of \u201cbad words\u201d. Most researchers agree that the main function of slurs is that of derogating or dehumanizing, of signalling that their targets are unworthy of equal standing or full respect as persons. Figuring out how slurs achieve their main function is an important topic in contemporary philosophy of language and linguistics. In this introductory course, my aim is to present the main characteristics of slurs and their uses (not limited to derogation), explore the main views on their semantics and pragmatics, and show how they are connected to larger social phenomena like power structures and communal identities.",

While we humans learn language through conversation, interactive language use is arguably the holy grail of speech and language processing. With large language modelling (LLM) approaches, progress was made towards building more interactive agents. Yet, modelling human-like conversational AI remains a moonshot. This foundational course delves into why modelling conversational competence is so challenging. It also takes stock of recent engineering breakthroughs in building conversational AI systems using instruction-tuned LLM models such as ChatGPT, Llama or Mistral. Students will learn the basics of interactive language modelling and explore the scientific and theoretical foundations of understanding structure and variation in conversational speech data in hands-on tutorials. We will work through recent empirical and computational work on speech corpora, speech recognition, and technology assessment. Aspects of conversational infrastructure covered include turn-taking, interactive repair, and action ascription. We conclude by touching upon societal and ethical issues that emerge alongside the rise of conversational AI. This course might appeal to anyone interested in recent approaches to conversational AI and understanding why talking machines still struggle to hold up their end of a conversation.

These include the notion of an abstract (or 'Kimean') state, the distinction between events and acts, the apparent categorization of verbs as event predicates as mass rather than dividing into mass and count, cartographic theory of adverbial modification and their linguistic motivations, and implications of theories of syntactic decomposition of verbs into light verb-noun complexes for event semantics.

Given that pragmatics is an interdisciplinary concern, it is hardly surprising that common ground has been discussed across a range of disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and computer science. But for all its importance, there has been relatively little discussion of foundational issues. There are radically different views on the nature of common ground, i.e. what common ground is, and there have been no attempts to compare and contrast these views at any length, and consider their implications for the analysis of speech acts and fiction, for example. In brief, that is the main objective of the course. We will compare and contrast three main views, two of which have been developed by Stalnaker: the container view and the psychological view. The latter is probably the dominant view on common ground, although there are quite a few researchers who consider it to be incoherent. The third view has its roots in Lewis's work on ``common knowledge''; it treats common ground as a normative concept. Each of these views is associated with a distinctive take on pragmatics, and especially with a distinctive account of what speech acts are and how they interact with the common ground.",

The course is designed for students of linguistics and neighboring disciplines, focusing on two key areas: phylogenetic methods and spatial statistics. Through these lenses, we will examine how linguistic features are inherited, and how they spread under language contact.

It is well-known that Gentzen-style sequent calculi fail to meet basic requirements in the case of modal logic: for instance, no cut-free sequent calculus is known for the modal logic S5. In order to overcome these difficulties, several extensions of Gentzen's formalism have been studied in the literature. These can be approximately grouped into two categories: labelled calculi, which extend the language of the calculus with explicit semantic information, and structured calculi, such as nested or hypersequent calculi, which instead include additional structural connectives into the structure of the sequents. We will discuss the main properties of these proof systems, including cut-freeness and modularity. Moreover, we will showcase how labelled and structured calculi are suitable to obtain decision procedures for the logics, focusing specifically on countermodel extraction from failed derivations. To conclude, we will compare the various proof systems (Gentzen-style, labelled, structured) by defining formal translations that allow one to convert derivations of one kind into equivalent derivations of the other kind.",

An English cleft construction is a sentence of the form It is ... who ..., as exemplified in (1).\n\n(1) It was Sally who danced.\n\nWe will first introduce hypotheses for capturing the meanings of clefts, their use conditions and their functions in discourse. In addition, we will discuss formal analyses that attempt to derive the cleft\u2019s exhaustive inference (e.g., nobody other than Sally danced in (1)), and analyses demonstrating interactions between clefts and Questions Under Discussion (Roberts, 2012). Up-to-date psycholinguistic studies and corpus research which cross-linguistically test these theoretical claims (e.g., in Chinese, German, etc.) will also be introduced alongside. We will examine various experimental designs, and investigate empirical results, which seem to clash with theoretical predictions. The goal of this course is not only to convey state-of-the-art knowledge on cleft constructions to the students, but also to inspire and explore new theoretical and empirical ideas together with the students.",

Every typology has an associated geometry which provides an inherent classification of the grammars that constitute it. In this course we will develop these notions, showing how constraints, which at the lowest level are numerical comparisons between linguistic candidates, can be abstractly viewed as providing comparisons between entire grammars. From this perspective, constraints provide both order and equivalence structures on the grammars, an \u201cEquivalence-augmented Partial Order\u201d (EPO), which determine all licit typological classifications of a given theory. The set of all such EPOs for a typology is termed the Mother of all Tableaux (MOAT).

              "description": "Among those mixing together Boolean concepts and modal concepts, the search for minimality has prompted multifarious debates. Most of these debates have now faded. In fact, they have not survived the end of the syntactic era of modal logic. Before the advent, in the 1960s, of the concept of Kripke frames, it was unclear which modal logic is the most appropriate candidate for the title of ``minimal modal logic''. Today, although the modal logic K does not contain any of the formulas expressing the properties usually associated to the modal concepts of necessity and possibility, everyone accepts the fact that K is the minimal modal logic. Among those combining together intuitionistic concepts and modal concepts, the quest for minimality has caused numerous discussions. Some of these discussions are still alive. Indeed, two approaches are in direct opposition: the intuitionistic approach set out by Fischer Servi (1977, 1978, 1984) giving rise to the intuitionistic modal logic IK and the constructive approach expounded by Wijesekera (1990) giving rise to the intuitionistic modal logics WK and CK. And there is no consensus of what should be the ``minimal intuitionistic modal logic''.\n\nThe reason for being of the intuitionistic approach set out by Fischer Servi is mainly the fact that a minimal intuitionistic modal logic should contain the formulas whose standard translation in a first-order language are intuitionistically valid. Therefore, the supporters of this approach consider intuitionistic modal logic IK that contains the formulas \u25ca(pVq)->\u25capV\u25caq and \u00ac<>false despite their non-constructive character. The justification of the constructive approach expounded by Wijesekera chiefly rests on the fact that the formulas of a minimal intuitionistic modal logic should have a constructive character. As a result, the upholders of this approach consider intuitionistic modal logic WK that does not contain the formula \u25ca(pVq)->\u25capV\u25caq. The most radical of them also consider intuitionistic modal logic CK that does not contain either the formula \u00ac<>false. There is no sense in comparing the arguments for and against the intuitionistic approach giving rise to the intuitionistic modal logic IK and the constructive approach giving rise to the intuitionistic modal logics WK and CK. To convince the reader of this opinion, it suffices to mention how these approaches differently define the truth condition of diamond-formulas in their relational semantics, although they consider the same truth condition of box-formulas. This difference in the definition of the truth condition of diamond-formulas shows that the connective \u25ca \u00e0 la Fischer Servi and the connective \u25ca \u00e0 la Wijesekera are as separate as are, for example, the connectives of disjunction and conjunction in any intermediate logic.\n\nIn this course, we firstly offer a self-contained overview of intermediate logics and modal logics. Secondly, we survey the different intuitionistic and constructive approaches to modal logic that have been proposed in the literature. We thirdly present the most important motivations for the introduction of such approaches: Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of logic, type systems for staged computation, formalization of distributed computation, hardware verification, etc. Fourthly, we develop the proof theory, the relational semantics and the algebraic semantics of the different intuitionistic and constructive approaches to modal logic. We fifthly introduce an appropriate candidate for the title of minimal intuitionistic modal logic, an intuitionistic modal logic strictly contained in IK and comparable neither with WK, nor with CK. For some of its extensions, we study the axiomatization/completeness and the decidability/complexity of the set of their valid formulas. This course will mainly address logical and computational aspects of the combination of intuitionistic concepts and modal concepts.",

Different notions of of explanation have been proposed and studied in the area of eXplainable AI (XAI), varying according to different dimensions such as global versus local and model-agnostic versus model-specific. In this course we will introduce several modal logics for explaining the behaviors and predictions of AI systems, including classifier systems and causal models, of which artificial neural networks are special instances. These logics support reasoning about different types of explanations including abductive, contrastive, counterfactual and causal explanation.

The conversational grounding process includes not just transmission of information via declarative utterances, but also visual, inferential, and interactive feedback processes. While there has been a substantial work on conversational grounding, many open problems remain, particularly when applied to different situations and activities, involving different numbers and types of participants, different perceptual and action affordances, and different goals. Moreover, new resources involving large language models change the nature of grounding processes and create new challenges even when they may improve the ability to solve some issues. The moment is therefore to bring together researchers working on aspects of Conversational Grounding for a workshop to increase common ground on the topic, and disseminate new best practices for computing, modeling and implementing conversational grounding in dialogue systems.",

Students will be shown the benefits of incrementality for improving speed, naturalness and fluidity of conversing with machines. Concretely, we will be looking at SDSs where processing information from user speech on a word-by-word basis is crucial. The course will cover how to deal with various natural, incremental phenomena in dialogue - such as spoken disfluencies, utterance continuations and interruptions - which standard dialogue systems cannot deal with, using incremental, semantically-driven natural language understanding and generation models. Each session is divided into a lecture, and a practical. During the practicals students work gradually towards building their own fully incremental SDS in a small domain, using the technical tools and API that we will provide. Our aim is that by the end of the course, students will appreciate the multi-faceted complexity of real-time language processing in dialogue.",

Because only a certain 'class' of elements happens to play a key role in this respect, namely additives ('too, also'-type) and comitatives ('with'-type) \u2013 i.e. expressions whose meaning usually has a conjunctive flavour. In inclusory constructions, however, they establish a 'part of'-relation instead, which is the hallmark of inclusory meaning, but at the same time forces us to reconsider or modify or formal- logical assumptions about these elements. The aim of this course is to provide an overview of an under-explored empirical phenomenon and to illustrate the formal challenges it presents us with.",

In this framework, modeling truth, reference and speech-acts in fiction starts from this idea that fictional texts are best construed as props in a game of make-believe. within this \u201cfunctionalist\u201d framework, an adequate semantic analysis of fictional discourse typically requires deploying a narrative element: on top of the representation of a storyworld, one needs a specific narrator-narrative-narratee structure. The semantics of fiction thus leads to narratology. We will look at how semantics and narratology do and should interact when it comes to modeling fictional discourse: first, investigating recent, controversial notions from the semantics of fiction which have a narratological flavour (esp. the fictional periphery, narrator-less fictions, the real-world vs. in-universe perspectives); second, looking at some recent advances in narratology explicitly raising foundational issues (esp. models for second-person narratives, metanarrative fictions).",

Scalarity has mainly been investigated within degree semantics, which aims to study how natural language expresses measurement and comparison along an abstract dimension, i.e., a scale composed of a totally ordered set of scalar values (degrees or intervals). Additivity is mainly about expressions that bring an existential presupposition in a domain of entities: e.g., additive particles like \"another\" presuppose the existence of a similar item. Recent research suggests a connection between scalarity and additivity (e.g., Greenberg 2010, Thomas 2010, Zhang and Ling 2021): comparison means additivity along a scale. This course addresses the conceptual, empirical, and technical aspects of this connection across domains. The course will start with an additivity-based perspective on comparatives, introducing the conceptual benefits and technical details of connecting research on scalarity and additivity. Then we will discuss various research questions within this perspective.",

              "description": "Paraconsistent logic is a family of theories on what can be logically concluded from contradictions, different from the family of theories according to which contradictions entail everything. By touching on core areas of theoretical inquiry, such as truth, falsity, logicality, negation, or rationality, paraconsistent logic has opened new research directions in philosophy, science, and technology. This is an introductory course to some of the most important work on paraconsistent logic from the last decade. I start by exploring two proposals for refining the notion of paraconsistent logic, because the mere failure of Ex Contradictione Quodlibet (ECQ) \u2013that everything follows from a contradiction\u2013 might not be sufficient to characterize a paraconsistent logic. The first proposal consists of demanding a pronouncement about the law of non-contradiction (LNC) as well, as apparently there is some tension in rejecting ECQ but accepting LNC. The second proposal asks for considering the appropriate versions of ECQ when meta-arguments \u2013i.e. arguments between arguments\u2013 are involved. No matter how paraconsistent logics are presented or defined, they typically lack validities that seem at least useful, if not necessary, for reasoning in general. Thus, some techniques to recover the validities lost in a paraconsistent logic are presented, paying special attention to using unary recover operators to express within the language that a proposition is consistent or inconsistent. Finally, less shy paraconsistent attitudes are presented, namely those leading to logics validating contradictions (and perhaps other classically false or contingent schemas) and the program of doing inconsistent mathematics without any intention of recovering classically valid results if they happen to fail. Suitable motivations and examples of these two latter approaches will be presented.",

This course reviews the literature on language model programming, starting from advanced prompting techniques in NLP to recent attempts in the programming language literature to build novel programming frameworks for LLMs. We then discuss and motivate alternative paradigms such as declarative model programming and probabilistic programming (based instead on tools such as logic and probabilistic inference). The course gives participants an understanding of the relevant literature, focusing especially on applications such as constrained decoding, interfacing LLMs with tools and model alignment.",

This course will (i) give students a sense of the wide and interdisciplinary range of (sometimes unexpected) applications of Aristotelian diagrams, (ii) discuss some of the fundamental logical and diagrammatic issues related to these diagrams, and (iii) introduce the methods and tools developed in logical geometry for studying these topics.

We provide different types of models as well as a simple qualitative modal language to reason about the concept of a 'strong enough' trigger of influence. Using fixed-point operators in our logic, important results from network theory about the characterization of informational cascades follow immediately from our logical axioms. Unfolding the influence dynamics in an epistemic social network allows us to characterize the epistemic conditions under which the dynamic diffusion process can speed up or slow down. The results presented in this talk are based on on-going joint work with Alexandru Baltag at the University of Amsterdam in [1] and on the paper in [2]. [1] Alexandru Baltag and Sonja Smets.

              "description": "A reference to Zellig Harris and John R. Firth is a standard, almost obligatory introductory step in current work in distributional semantics. But such references usually remain shallow, without entailing a real engagement with the actual work of both authors. This talk will try to (partially) fill that gap by indicating some differences between the position of Harris and contemporary approaches, and likewise, differences between Harris and Firth. Such an analysis may help, not only to get a clearer idea of the variety of current forms of distributional semantics, but also to identify a number of hidden issues, viz. involving the role of linguistic intuition and semantic interpretation in a distributional framework.",

              "description": "In this lecture, I sketch out some quite severe theoretical problems with the current approach in Minimalist Syntax to dealing with the locality of grammatical dependencies in natural language. I trace some of these problems back to the theory\u2019s set-theoretic foundations, and propose an alternative view of what syntactic objects are, that takes them to have a part-whole based, as opposed to a set-member based structure. I show how a developing this idea in a few simple ways can provide a new and elegant theory that sidesteps the problems in standard Minimalist theory and directly captures some central results about the locality of grammatical dependencies. Time permitting, I\u2019ll also show that it opens up a novel way of thinking about island effects that is consistent with recent empirical and experimental findings.",

This works surprisingly well, and the linguistic theories of syntax and discourse reveal why.  However, LLMs do not tap other types of distributions that figure prominently in scientific theories of language. This talk will analyze some cases where their performance falls short of human performance as a result. It will look at cases in which formal semantics specifies representations with hidden variables, which range over inferred rather than overt aspects of the context. It will also show that LLMs lack meta-level relations that linguistic theory shows to be essential for capturing abstract generalizations.",
